# Î»-calculus

An experiment in programming language implementation, written by accident while taking the ANU's COMP1130 course on Haskell and the lambda calculus. This is a poorly documented attempt at writing an interpreter for lambda calculus terms in a way that is usable to write actual (untyped) programs, which is enabled by hacking in representations for lists and strings.
